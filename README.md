# Hardhat UserStorage Demo Project

Create, *compile*, *deploy* and *verify* Smart Contracts with [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).

## Create a Smart Contract

- Create a new contract in the *contracts* folder.
- Create a deploy script for it
- Run the script

## Compile Smart Contracts

The command below compiles every *.sol* file in your contracts folder.

```shell
npm run compile
```

You can find the compiled contracts in the *artifacts* folder

## Deploy Smart Contracts to different Networks

To deploy a contract to a remote network you need a url and a private key.  

- For getting a url, go to [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?r=7b980bb14402be0b), sign up, create a new App in its dashboard

- For the private key you need to install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), create an account and export its private key

- To verify your smart contracts, sign up to [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) and create an API Key

### Hardhat (Default)

Hardhat comes built-in with Hardhat Network, a local Ethereum network node designed for development

```shell
npm run deploy
```

### Hardhat (Localhost)

```shell
npm run deploy:localhost
```

### Ganache

[Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) is a personal blockchain running on your own mashine on port 7545.

```shell
npm run deploy:ganache
```

### Goerli

[Goerli](https://goerli.net/) is an Ethereum test network that allows for blockchain development testing before deployment on Mainnet, the main Ethereum network.

```shell
npm run deploy:goerli
```

## Testing Smart Contracts

Writing automated tests when building smart contracts is of crucial importance.
We can use [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) test runner and the [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) assertion library.

### Running Tests

```shell
npm run test
```

### Running Tests with Coverage

For test coverage you need to install the [solidity-coverage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/solidity-coverage) package.

```shell
npm run coverage
```
